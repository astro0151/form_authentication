# form_authentication  //this note is for my learning purpose
this is basic form authentication project using html,bootstrap and javascript
i've used quite inline css to change the color of alert message to red.
to use bootstrap i've used cdn link from getbootstrap.com.
this form_authentication project is like real time scenario of login and sign up page linked to each other.user can go to sign up page by just clicking new user link
mentioned bottom to the submit button.
javascript is used to authentication of field required.
to prevent browser default behavior i've used html attribute called onclick with the return value false. we can use another way to prevent browser default behavior
which keeps refreshing page.
No external css or js file is used.
No authentication for length of password ,usename lenght, type of charactor,or anything.
javascript is used only to authenticate the input value it is there or not no matter lenght.if no vale there will be aleart as required field.

tip: Don't use required attribute to authenticate the form that's not recommended by profesionals.
